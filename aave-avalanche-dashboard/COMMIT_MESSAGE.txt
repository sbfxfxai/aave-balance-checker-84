feat: Fix payment amount transfer to use exact user input

## Critical Fix - Payment Amount Accuracy
Fixed the issue where payments were transferring inflated amounts (e.g., 1.106221 USDC) 
instead of the exact user input amount (e.g., 1.00 USDC).

### Root Cause
- Frontend stores payment_info with correct deposit amount (1.00) ✅
- Frontend sends total amount with fees (1.05+) to process-payment.ts ❌
- process-payment.ts was using body.amount (total with fees) instead of payment_info amount ❌

### Changes
- process-payment.ts: Added Redis lookup to get original deposit amount from payment_info
- webhook.ts: Removed fallback calculations from Square total, enforced payment_info usage
- Maintained immediate funding while fixing amount source

### Impact
- Users now see exactly the amount they input transferred to Aave
- No more confusion from fee-inflated transfer amounts
- Preserves instant funding experience
